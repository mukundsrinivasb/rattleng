This **Script** tab captures all interactions with Rattle as an *R
script*. You can see the full script on the right here.

You can **Save** the script to a file to replicate what you have done
in Rattle directly in R. And even better, you can use that script as
the starting point for doing even more in R. 

Review R's documentation and tune your plots, for example, to add a
bit of style and make them engaging for your audience. 

By default the script is saved as the file *script.R* in your home
folder (or from where you started up Rattle).

To run a file as an R script use the command line like:

```
$ Rscript script.R
``` 

If you start up R itself, like the R Console or RStudio, run the
script using:

```
> source('script.R')
```
